# Photo Memory
**[Oct 2nd, 2014] This project is  a work in progress.**  

### Overview
Photo Memory makes it easy to share photos of an event between friends and family. Simply create a shared gallery and send the unique link out to your friends. Each friend can enter in a URL to wherever their photos are stored (Dropbox, facebook, Google Drive). Photo Memory will aggregate and display these photos in one place.

## How it works
A user gives Photo Memory a URL to a public shared photo album from Dropbox, Google, or Facebook. Photo Memory will scrape this page, aggregating the image URLs. Photo Memory then displays all of this content in a single aggregated webpage.
